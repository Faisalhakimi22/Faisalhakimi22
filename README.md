## About Me ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student with a strong interest in data analysis and a passion for exploring the frontiers of machine learning,
particularly in computer vision and large language models (LLMs).  
I'm adept at handling regression tasks and intrigued by the potential of reinforcement learning (RL).
My foundation is built on a solid understanding of classical machine learning algorithms, 
and I enjoy applying these techniques with a strong mathematical background.  
Currently, I'm actively involved in projects that leverage my knowledge of computer vision and LLMs. 
I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on fascinating problems in this rapidly evolving field.
